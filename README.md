This framework provides one of the most essential and basic functionality developing any web app. It has user module that allows a super user to login and perform CRUD operations on users.

RSR is a framework that provides an easy starting point for ReactJS, Sails(Node.js), and Redis server based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing RSR based web apps with useful modules like Waterline(ORM) and Passport pre-bundled and configured.
